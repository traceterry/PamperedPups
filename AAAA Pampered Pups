        <h2>Welcome to Pampered Pups-where your dog waggles more and barks less!</h2>
            <p>We're a full service pet grooming salon, daycare, and boarding kennel, without our own doggie-treat bark-ery. Located in the heart of Pembroke Pines, Florida, we're commited to making sure your "best friend" is treated with the same Tender Love-n-Care your pet has come to know and expect.</p>
            <p>Please explore our site and learn how your pet can get some well-deserved pampering. Even better, contact us to schedule a tour, or just drop in for a visit. You'll see for yourself how our pet-loving staff is trained to sit up and listen when your dog speaks!</p>
